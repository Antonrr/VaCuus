 *
 * WHERE THIS RUNS, AND WHY (the Task 3 placement decision): on the Slate element, called
 * once per ARRIVING published buffer from SetPendingBuffer_RenderThread — never from
 * Draw_RenderThread. Publishes are the gated, ~zero-when-idle event; engine frames are
 * not, so parsing here keeps the per-engine-frame glass path down to reads of a list that
 * already exists. Element-side rather than recorder-side because the failure mode the
 * spec's removal test guards ("a distiller that early-outs on glass-free buffers leaves
 * the last panel's blur running forever", spec §2(a)) lives at the point where the OLD
 * list could survive — and that point is wherever the list persists, which is here. A
 * recorder-side distiller would still need an element-side adoption step, i.e. the same
 * bug surface one hop removed, plus a buffer-borne list every publish. The struct itself
 * is thread-agnostic data-in/data-out (single-writer, like the recorder) so unit tests
 * drive it directly with recorder-produced buffers, no render thread required.
 *
 * THE WHOLESALE-REPLACEMENT INVARIANT (spec §2(a), the removal test): every call rebuilds
 * Entries from the given buffer alone — the FIRST statement of Distill() is the Reset().
 * There is no early-out above it, and must never be: each published buffer repaints the
 * whole frame (the replayer's own drain contract), so a buffer without a glass signature
 * MEANS the glass is gone.
 *
 * The two cross-buffer maps live here because their feed and retirement ride the same
 * per-published-buffer call: filter handle → sigma (compiled in one buffer, referenced by
 * composites in later ones; filters are cross-frame resources) and mask geometry handle →
 * payload copy (the clip geometry is compiled once and referenced by every subsequent
 * glass frame — cross-buffer exactly like draws). Both retire on the buffer's Released*
 * arrays, AFTER the commands are parsed (the buffer carrying a release may still
 * reference the handle — the replayer's deferred-release rule, applied to parsing).
